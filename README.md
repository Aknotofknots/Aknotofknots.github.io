# Final School project
.....
# By Christian Ahls√©n
======================
### School: Lernia
### Program: Frontend-Javasript Developer
### Course: HTML, CSS, Javascript and webstandards

Goal: make use of all the knowledge gained during the course.

The technologies used in this course are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
I used Bootstrap and custom CSS to style the page, Javascript mostly for DOM-manipulation and jQuery for effects.
