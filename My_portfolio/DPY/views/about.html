            <h3>About me</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            As a child I wasn't overly interested in computers and technology in general. I would often make drawings, play video games(alot)and play the guitar rather than indulge myself in the technology itself of all the things surrounding me. Nowadays I spend most of my time doing the opposite. if I'm about to learn some new software I want to know EVERYTHING in a kind of obsessive way(which sometimes gets the better of me). It took me quite a while to figure out what I wanted to do. I've studied a lot of things and among those things are: the japanese language(for about 3,5 years) ,sound engineering and lately programming which made it clear to me what I wanted to continue doing.

            <h3> What can I teach other people?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>I'm well-versed in Japanese and sound-engineering. I also have basic/intermediate programmingskills in C-sharp. Please let me know if you have any questions(or just want to get to know me), give me a holler on my facebook page, twitter or linkedin.
